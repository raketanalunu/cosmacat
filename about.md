<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/avatar.jpg" class="avatar">Cosma is a cute and the most kind blind cat from Saint-Petersburg. She lives happily in a family since 2011. The baby cat is very funny and sweet, she also behaves as an ordinary cat, that even makes some people doubts in her blindness:)

We found Cosma in December when she was only one and a half month. Someone has thrown her dying in the street in severe frost. The frozen kitten was in an awful condition. Apart from fleas, terrible hunger and flu, the baby couldn't open her eyes because of strong suppuration. The kitten has recovered in few weeks, but there still was a problem with her eyes for several years. Unfortunately it is impossible to return Cosmaâ€™s eyessight.

During life Cosma met many kind and sympathetic friends and despite all difficulties she is now a playful tender and grateful cat. You can be convinced of it;)
